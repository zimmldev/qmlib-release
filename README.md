## Using a License with QMLib

To unlock the full features of QMLib, you need a valid license key and signature. Follow the steps below to set up your license.

---

### 1. Purchase a License

Click the **Subscribe** button above to purchase a license.
After completing the purchase, a license key will be sent to the email address you provided.

---

### 2. Generate a Signature

Using the license key, you need to generate a signature in your CMake build system. Hereâ€™s how:

```cmake
# Set the license key
set(LICENSE_KEY "<license_key>") # Replace <license_key> with your actual license key

# Call the validate_license function and store the result
validate_license("${LICENSE_KEY}" LICENSE_SIGNATURE)
```

### 3. Configure License in CMake
Add the license key and signature to your build definitions:

```cmake
# Add definitions for the key and signature
add_definitions(-DQMLIB_KEY="${LICENSE_KEY}")
add_definitions(-DQMLIB_SIGNATURE="${LICENSE_SIGNATURE}")
```

### 4. Use the License in C++ Code
Set up the license in your application code as follows:

```Cpp
#include <license/QMLib.h>

int main() {
   ...
   
   // Initialize the license
   QMLib::setLicense(QMLIB_KEY, QMLIB_SIGNATURE);

   ...
}
```
  
Ensure that the QMLib target is linked in your CMake configuration:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_target_name PRIVATE QMLib::QMLib)
```

By following these steps, your application will be properly licensed and ready to utilize the full capabilities of QMLib.

### Note on License Checks
All license checks with the server are performed only at compile time. The generated software does not perform any server pings or license checks at runtime. This ensures that the application operates independently without requiring an active internet connection after compilation.

By following these steps, your application will be properly licensed and ready to utilize the full capabilities of QMLib.
